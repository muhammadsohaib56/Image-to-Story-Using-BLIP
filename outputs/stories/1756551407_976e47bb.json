  "story": "Once upon a time, in a city bustling with yellow cabs and towering buildings that scraped the sky, lived a kind man named Mr. Finch.  He wore a crisp white shirt, so bright it almost shone, and a dark tie that looked like a midnight sky. Every morning, Mr. Finch walked to his special place â€“ a little park tucked away between busy streets.  The park was filled with the sweet smell of blooming flowers and the happy chirping of birds.  Mr. Finch loved to sit on a bench beneath a big, leafy tree, its branches reaching up like welcoming arms.\n\n\nOne day, a little girl with bright red shoes and a giggle as bubbly as lemonade dropped her ice cream cone. Tears welled up in her eyes, bigger than the shiny sprinkles on the fallen treat.  Mr. Finch, seeing her distress, gently knelt beside her.  He had a smile as warm as the summer sun and eyes as blue as the clearest sky. He offered her a bright, red handkerchief, as soft as a bunny's fur, to wipe her tears.\n\n\nHe didn't have another ice cream cone, but he did have something even better: a story.  He told her a tale of a brave little squirrel who found a hidden acorn, its shell as smooth as polished stone. The little girl listened, her sadness melting away like snow in the spring.  By the time the story ended, her smile was as radiant as the sunbeams dappling through the leaves, and Mr. Finch's white shirt seemed to glow even brighter.",
